1.	FROM python:3.9-slim: This line will specify the base image to use for the Docker container. Here, this is  using an official Python runtime image based on Python 3.9 with a slim variant, which means it contains only essential components, resulting in a smaller image size.
--- what is Python runtime image?
	It is a prebuilt docker image that will contain specific version of python installed along with any required dependencies and configurations which will help to run python applications within Docker container.
 
2.	WORKDIR /app: This line sets the working directory inside the container to /app. This directory will be used as the main location for the application code and any related files.
In summary, /app in the Dockerfile represents the path to the working directory inside the Docker container, where the application code and related files are located.

3.	RUN apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y && apt-get install -y gcc default-libmysqlclient-dev pkg-config \: 
This line updates the package lists for available upgrades and installs necessary packages. 
gcc is a compiler for the C programming language, default-libmysqlclient-dev provides development files for the MySQL database client library, and pkg-config is a helper tool used when compiling applications and libraries.

4.	COPY requirements.txt .: This line copies the requirements.txt file from the Docker build context (the directory containing the Dockerfile) into the /app directory in the container. This file typically lists all Python dependencies required by the application.

5.	RUN pip install mysqlclient: This line installs the mysqlclient Python package using pip, which is a MySQL database connector for Python. It's a dependency often used when working with MySQL databases in Python applications.

6.	RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt: This line installs Python dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file. The --no-cache-dir flag tells pip not to cache downloaded packages, which can help reduce the size of the Docker image.

7.	COPY . . : This line copies the remaining application code from the Docker build context into the /app directory in the container. This includes any Python source code, configuration files, or other resources needed to run the application.

8.	CMD ["python", "app.py"]: This line specifies the default command to run when the container starts. Here, it runs the Python script app.py, which is presumably the main entry point for the application.

Overall, this Dockerfile sets up an environment suitable for running a Python application with MySQL database connectivity inside a Docker container. It installs necessary system dependencies, copies application code and dependencies, and specifies the command to run the application.

Docker: Docker helps developers package their software and all its dependencies (like libraries and settings) into a neat, portable container that can run on any computer.
Example: Imagine you're making a sandwich. Normally, you'd gather all the ingredients and assemble them on a plate. Docker is like a lunchbox that lets you package up your sandwich neatly so you can carry it anywhere without worrying about the mess. 

Docker Registry: A Docker Registry is like a book where developers can store and share their Docker containers. This way, anyone can access and download the containers they need to run software on their own computer.
Example: Now, let's say you've made this sandwich, and your friends want to try it too. You can't physically hand them your lunchbox, but you can make copies of your sandwich recipe and share it with them.
